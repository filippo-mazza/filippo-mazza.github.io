Hi, this is my personal web page on Github ! I am a data scientist and researcher focused on using machine learning for businesses. I love deep learning, data mining, information retrieval, network analysis, and active learning.

I am currently working in the Big Data Threat Analytics team of Huawei, in the German Research Center in Munich.
